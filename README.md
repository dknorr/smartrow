# Welcome to SmartRow
This is a project created during the Out in Tech Mentorship Program of Spring 2020

## Purpose
This application generates even boatings of rowers based on provided rower statistics. It takes a greedy approach to minimizing the adjusted power difference in boats. 

## Stack
This is a lightweight serverless Python Flask application run on AWS as a Lambda function. 

## Deployment
Check out the deployed application here: https://37yuwuqyjg.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/upload-file. Some sample input is included in this repository. Feel free to change values and see how the output is affected. The input format, however, is inflexible.
